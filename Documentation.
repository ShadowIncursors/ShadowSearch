ShadowSearch: Anonymous Search Engine
OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION.

Description

ShadowSearch is an anonymous search engine that guarantees privacy and security when browsing the web. The project aims to provide an uncompromising browsing experience, where user anonymity is a priority. Based on a distributed and secure network, ShadowSearch allows you to perform trace-free online searches, hiding the identity and activities of users through end-to-end encryption and a secure connection.

With ShadowSearch, users can browse the web completely anonymously, avoiding the collection of personal data and the tracking of their online activities.
