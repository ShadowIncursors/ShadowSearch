## Privacy & Security

ShadowSearch is designed with privacy as the primary concern:

- No data is sent to external servers without encryption
- All search history is stored locally and can be cleared at any time
- The Panic Button feature allows instant clearing of all sensitive data
- Stealth Mode hides the app interface when potential threats are detected

## How to Use

1. **Search**: Enter your query in the search bar on the home screen
2. **View Results**: Browse through encrypted search results
3. **Open Content**: Content opens within the app's secure browser
4. **Manage Security**: Adjust security settings to your preference
5. **Emergency**: Use the Panic Button in case of emergency
